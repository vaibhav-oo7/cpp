0. Title: maths Modular Exponentiation
Description: Given below the code to calculate the Modular Exponentiation(x<sup>y</sup> % mod) fastly. What is the time complexity of this?
```
int power( int x, int y, int mod ) 
{ 
    int res = 1;
    x = x % mod;
    while (y > 0) 
    { 
        if (y & 1) 
            res = (res*x) % mod;;
        y = y>>1; 
        x = (x*x) % mod;;   
    } 
    return res; 
}
```

6. Title: math probabilty - boxes
Description: Initially, you are given 2 boxes, 50 red balls and 50 blue balls. <br>You have to distribute all the balls in the two boxes. After distributing the balls, a box will be randomly selected and randomly a ball will be picked from that selected box. You will distribute the balls in such a way to maximize the chance of picking red ball. Maximum probability of picking the red ball you can get from this scheme is?

2.0.747 //correct
3.0.821
